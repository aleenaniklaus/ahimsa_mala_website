# Ahimsa Mala Website

Website for [ahimsamala.com][ahimsamala.com] which was also my final project for my full stack course. Used a Boostrap package and edited the CSS to my needs/liking. If you would like to use the itemPage and take payments some options are using PayPal buttons (HTML generated from inside of PayPal website), Stripe, etc. I have not personally used Stripe but have heard great things. You may need to create your own button with Stripe which you can do by referencing the Bootstrap docs [here][https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/], and using jQuery to listen in when the button is pressed.

Uses:
 - Bootstrap
 - HTML
 - express
 - jQuery
